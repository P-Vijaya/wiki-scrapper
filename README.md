# Introduction
### The **'wikishorts'** is a shorter version of wikipedia. We generally search wikipedia for information on the particular topic, but information provided takes too long to read completely, but wikishorts solves this problem by by scrapping all the data inside a wikipedia and summarizing the text and provide a shorter version, thus taking shortest time to read and understand about a topic. Along with it also provides links of all references and images inside a wikipedia for better knowledge.
