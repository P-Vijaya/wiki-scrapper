# Introduction
### The **'wikishorts'** is a shorter version of wikipedia. We generally search wikipedia to get information on the particular topic, but it takes too long to read completely, but wikishorts solves this problem by scrapping the data inside the wikipedia,it summariizes the text and displays the information in brief and in precise manner, thus taking less amount of time to read. wikishorts also scraps the links of references and images from wikipedia and displays in a easy accessible way.
