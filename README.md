# Introduction
### The **'wikishorts'** is a shorter version of wikipedia. We generally search wikipedia for information on the particular topic, but information provided takes too long to read completely, but wikishorts solves this problem by summarizing the text and provide a shorter version, thus taking few seconds to understand about a topic. Along with it also provides links of all references and images inside a wikipedia for better understanding.
# Demo
